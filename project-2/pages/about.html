    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>Hello, this is Jude MacDonald, an animation wanabee using Source Filmmaker as my primary canvas of which my creations come to life! I'm currently designing a website dedicating to helping push you, the audience, to animate using SFM!</p>
    <p>I chose SFM because, funnily enough, I've just finished a little animation project on my own time, which was a chore and a half to get finalized. And to me, it'd be a crime for me to not talk to you about SFM.</p>
    <p>The best place to find good results with SFM would be on YouTube. Like, seriously, that's one of the absolutely best places to look up how to do SFM, because as helpful as the SFM team are with this type of stuff, they don't necessarily go into the nuances of just how powerful SFM can be, especially for what is essentially freeware!</p>
    <p>This video down here is a tutorial about the lighting within the Source Filmmaker. It'd be pretty useful to have cinematic-esque lighting in your animations, yeah?</p>
