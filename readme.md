# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo

## Jude MacDonald

I primarily took this class to enhance my admittedly weak coding skills, in addition to gaining more insight on web-based coding.

- The Internet as we know it was a culmination of years of investments and ideas to make a non-centralized network that can continue operation, even when a node is taken down.
- The Internet owes its existence to an experimental network project called "ARPANET", which was a governmental project that started to deviate from the centralized network idea towards a distributed network.
- One of the biggest breakthroughs of the Internet was actually from CERN, where having an entire database of experiments, hypotheses, and theories that can easily be accessed by other peers without the hassle of having to browse through libraries worth of documents.
