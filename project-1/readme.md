# An Official Internet Spider: Now on the World Wide Web (or an io)!

The web browser I most often use is Google Chrome. A browser functions by using a user interface to visually interpret what our web browser would do, web languages like html and css to render a site in front of our eyes, networks to enable itself to recieve new content, a specialized JavaScript interpreter, and a data storage bank for cookies and other forms of data.

Used the Wayback Machine to see what Google looked like back in the turn of the millenia. Back then in January 25th, 1999, Google did not have its own dedicated email server or drives or, well, really anything! It was barebones and everything was just right there for everyone to see! Nowadays, however, it has a myriad of goodies while still retaining its services, though you won't find as many links there as you would have in 1999.

## Work Cycle Reports

- In this assignment, I decided to put my image before the lyrics of my song, mainly to serve as a precursor for what will come. In this case, it comes from a video game, so I used a small image that relates to the video game.
- I had to learn that I should pace myself, otherwise I'll just be stuck trying to push when I should pull at that moment. That and the yml files are more useful for the md files at this moment than it is for the html files.
- None in particular, maybe a bit more on the html side, though it's pretty packed as it is.
- I have not seen any real problems back in assignment 2, though I hope they are able to get markdown to a T.
