    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to <em>350 Degrees Fahrenheit</em></li>
      <li>To prepare bread crumbs: <strong>Tear</strong> the bread slices into pieces. Stick them in a microwave oven for one minute on High. After that, pulse it in a <em>food processor</em> with parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper.</li>
      <li>Put flour, beaten eggs, and bread crumbs into <em>three seperate bowls</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Pound</strong> the three chicken breasts to equal thickness in between two sheets of plastic wrap. Afterwards, cut into 1 <sub>1/2</sub> inch strips and dry the strips. Dredge with flour, shake off any excess, lightly coat them in egg, let any excess drip back into egg bowl, finally coating them with bread crumbs and laying them onto a plate with wax paper lined on it.</li>
      <li>Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a hot skillet over medium heat until shimmering hot. Lay strips into the oil, don't turn them until the breading is golden brown --around two minutes in--. Turn the chicken, cook the other side until chicken is cooked through and golden brown. Rinse and repeat until done. Transfer cooked chicken onto a plate lined with paper towels. Serve and enjoy!</li>
