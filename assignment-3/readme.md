# Hyperlinks and Listings! Doing Recipes and Contact Information!

There can only be one Head and Body elements. The Head element is where meta information will be stored and, unless stated otherwise, will not be visible to the user, such as the title of the page. In this essence, the Body element will be where the user gets and absorbs their information from, styled in many different ways according to type of media or type of text.

The Structural Markups are a sort of "skeleton" for the Body of a web page. It's where the information could be separated through blocks or united under a single paragraph. They make sure that the information presented to the audience is in an orderly fashion that won't end up breaking down. Semantic Markups are more akin to "upgrades" for certain pieces of information. Often, they're used to reinforce the information provided to the audience, mainly to draw attention towards a particular portion in a paragraph.

## Work Cycle Reports
- Here, most of the information I had to get was from both the main website as well as some referencing from my fellow students' HTML code and my own code. One of the most blatant forms of referencing was using the <center></center> pieces of code, directly inspired by Ryan Stipe's usage of the code in his work. I loved how he has his information right down the center, in contrast to the default left-leaning position the HTML applies to anything.
- Most of the problems applied to how I need to structure my page, relative to our new base of knowledge on our HTML code. Really, simply reading the lesson provided to us was enough for me to overcome this problem.
- Meta tags seems to be most intriguing to me. Perhaps that's how they can store cookies for other websites?
- One of the best pieces of advise I can offer to my classmates is to make sure that you spell "mailto" and not "malto", because that's how it should spelt out in HTML.
